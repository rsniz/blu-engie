## Description

This is a simple single server management bot developed for the [TF2 Maníacos Community](https://tf2maniacos.com.br). It was created to provide custom functionalities tailored to our needs, and ownership of our own data.

The project is released publicly under the [MIT license](LICENSE) for transparency and to allow contributions. It is custom made to us and probably won't suit your Discord server as is, but feel free to use any part of the code you may find helpful.

## About Language

The TF2 Maníacos Community is a community for the brazilian fans of [Team Fortress 2](https://www.teamfortress.com). While we communicate primarily in Brazilian Portuguese, and this is our chosen language for all the bot's commands and messages, we have chosen English for the project documentation to cater to a wider audience of developers.

There is a point to be made about adding localization features to the project, so it can be adapted more easily to other communities. This is a low priority task right now but could be considered in the future.

## How to Contribute

If you would like to contribute, please open an issue and let us know what changes you are trying to address. And thank you for considering contributing to our project!
